# Hey there!

### Thanks!

> First off, thank you for considering contributing to goclone.

### Why Guidelines?

> Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What kinds of contributions you are amazing?

> goclone is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into goclone itself.

# Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing to Goclone? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

### 1. Fork the repo

### 2. Create a branch from `master`

> Navigate to Github and select the drop down menu and name the branch with your username pre-pended: `imthaghost/feature` In your local development environment pull down the newly created branch:

    ```bash
    $ git pull
    ```

### 3. If you've added code, add tests.

### 4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.

### 5. Make sure your code lints.

## 6. Issue that pull request!

> For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

> 1.  Create your own fork of the code
> 2.  Do the changes in your fork

### If you have a different process for small or "obvious" fixes, let them know.

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
>
> As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>
> -   Spelling / grammar fixes
> -   Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
> -   Comment clean up
> -   Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
> -   Adding logging messages or debugging output
> -   Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
> -   Moving source files from one directory or package to another

### Filing Bugs.

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
>    General questions should go to the golang-nuts mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

### Feature Suggestions

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in goclone, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

### Who accepts contributions after it’s been submitted?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
